h1. play-shell

A fun-side-project of mine turned out to be a CLI for Play-Framework apps based on the Groovysh.

!https://github.com/grandfatha/play-shell/raw/master/doc/img/play-shell.png!

h2. Usage

1. clone the repo

bc. git clone git://github.com/grandfatha/play-shell.git

2. add the dependency to your app, e.g. add the following to your dependencies.yml file

bc. require:
    - play
    - play-shell -> play-shell

bc. repositories: 
    - local-modules: 
        type: local 
        artifact: <absolute-path-to-your-git-clone>/[module] 
        contains: 
            - play-shell

3. Point your Terminal to your app and run 'play shell'
4. Have fun!
