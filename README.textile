h1. Play-Shell

A fun-side-project of mine turned out to be a CLI for Play-Framework apps based on the Groovysh.

h2. To use:

1. clone the repo
2. add the dependency to your app, e.g. add the following to your dependencies.yml file

require:
    - play
    - play-shell -> play-shell

repositories: 
    - local-modules: 
        type: local 
        artifact: <absolute-path-to-your-git-clone>/[module] 
        contains: 
            - play-shell

3. Point your Terminal to your app and run 'play shell'
4. ???
5. Profit!
